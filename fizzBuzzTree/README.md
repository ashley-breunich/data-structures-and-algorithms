# FizzBuzz Tree
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value.

## Challenge
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.

Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:

* If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
* If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
* If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”

Return the tree with its news values.

## Approach & Efficiency
Time -> 0(n)
Space -> 0(2n) - I created an array and each value was pushed to that array so that I could test for correct values.
